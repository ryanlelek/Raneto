==========

We do our best to accept all PRs that help advance the project.  
Thanks for your contributions!

## Process

1) Fork the Raneto repository
2) Make your edits
3) Open a Pull Request against the `master` branch ([Here's How](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github#create-pull-request))
4) Ensure all tests pass in the PR with TravisCI (and hopefully you added a few tests too?)
5) Wait for review and discussion. Do poke us if a few days elapse to remind us.
6) Your code will be merged if accepted!
