Raneto is a Knowledgebase platform for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) that uses static
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) files to power the knowledgebase.

Raneto can be called a "static site generator" of sorts as it doesn't require a database. All
of your content is stored in the `content` folder in Markdown (`.md`) files and the entire
knowledgebase structure and content is generated by Raneto. This is good because it's:

* **Simple:** You can create and manage an entire knowledge base using your favorite text editor
* **Flat:** Raneto is a "flat file" CMS, meaning no database problems, no MySQL queries, nothing
* **Fast:** Raneto is seriously lightweight and doesn't use a database, making it super fast

Raneto also features:

* [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) for easy templating
* Responsive default template (powered by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/))
* [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) code syntax highlighting
* Full-text search powered by [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/)
* [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
