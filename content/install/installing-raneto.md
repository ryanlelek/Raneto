Title: Installing Raneto
Sort: 2

Once you are sure you have met the [minimum requirements](%base_url%/install/requirements) you can install
Raneto by following these steps:

It is recommended to create a new Git repository to store your documentation files and then install Raneto as a dependency into it.  
See the `example/` directory for how this implementation works.

1. Switch to your existing or new project directory
2. Add Raneto to your project via NPM's package.json file or downloading the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/gilbitron/Raneto/releases)
3. In a terminal, run `npm install` to install the node dependencies
4. To start Raneto, run `npm start` (or `npm run start_win` on Windows)
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser

You can now start [creating pages](%base_url%/usage/creating-pages).

**NOTE:** See the [Production Notes](%base_url%/install/production-notes) when installing for a live site.
